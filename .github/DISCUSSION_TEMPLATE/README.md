# Doc
Quand on edit un fichier sur Github, cette documentation pop up et pour une certaine raison, elle est meilleure que celle en ligne donc la voici.

Encore une fois, voici le guide recommand√© par Github pour [apprendre le YAML en Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/yaml/).

## Top-level configuration options

- `labels` (Array or String): This discussion will automatically receive these labels upon creation. Can be array of labels or comma-delimited string, e.g. "question,shipped"
- `title` (String): Default title that will be pre-populated in the discussion submission form.
- `body` (Array): Definition of user inputs.

## Input type configuration options
### Markdown

Markdown blocks contain arbitrary text that a maintainer can add to a template, to provide extra context or guidance to a contributor. Supports Markdown formatting. **This text will not be rendered in the submitted discussion body**.

#### Required Fields

- `value` (String): The text that will be rendered. Markdown formatting is supported.

_Tip #1: YAML processing will cause the hash symbol to be treated as a comment. To insert Markdown headers, wrap your text in quotes._

_Tip #2: For multi-line text, you can use the pipe operator._
#### Example
```YAML
body:
- type: markdown
  value: "## Welcome!"
- type: markdown
  attributes:
    value: |
      Thanks for taking the time to start a new discussion! If you need real-time help, join us on Discord.
```

### Input

Inputs are single-line form input fields. Contributors may use markdown formatting in their responses.

#### Required Attributes

- `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.

#### Optional Attributes

- `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.
- `placeholder` (String): Renders as semi-transparent "placeholder" element in the input field when it's empty.
- `value` (String): Default text that is pre-populated in the input field.

#### ID

- `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

#### Validations

- `required` (Boolean): If `true`, the form will not be submittable until this is filled out.

Example
```YAML
body:
- type: input
  id: suggestion
  attributes:
    label: Suggestion
    description: "How might we make this project better?"
    placeholder: "Adding a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file would be a great idea."
  validations:
    required: true
```

### Textarea

Very similar to inputs, textareas are multiple-line form input fields. Typically used if you'd like a contributor to provide an answer longer than a few words. Contributors may use markdown formatting in their responses.

#### Required Attributes

- `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.

#### Optional Attributes

- `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.
- `placeholder` (String): Renders as semi-transparent "placeholder" element in the input field when it's empty.
- `value` (String): Default text that is pre-populated in the input field.
- `render` (String): If a value is provided, user-submitted text will be formatted into a codeblock automatically.

#### ID

- `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

#### Validations

- `required` (Boolean): If `true`, the form will not be submittable until this is filled out.

#### Example
```YAML
body:
- type: textarea
  id: improvements
  attributes:
    label: Top 3 improvements
    description: "What are the top 3 improvements we could make to this project?"
    value: |
      1.
      2.
      3.
      ...
    render: bash
  validations:
    required: true
```

### Dropdown

Users can select their answer from options defined by the maintainer.

#### Required Attributes

- `label` (String): A brief description of the expected user input.
- `options` (String Array): Set of values that user can select from to answer. Cannot be empty, and all choices must be distinct.

#### Optional Attributes

- `description` (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.
- `multiple` (Boolean): If `true`, users can submit multiple selections.

#### ID

- `id` (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `_`.

#### Validations

- `required` (Boolean): If `true`, the form will not be submittable until at least one choice is selected.

Example
```YAML
body:
- type: dropdown
  id: download
  attributes:
    label: Which area of this project could be most improved?
    options:
      - Documentation
      - Pull request review time
      - Bug fix time
      - Release cadence
  validations:
    required: true
```

### Checkboxes

A group of one or more checkboxes. This will be saved as a Markdown checkbox, and will continue to support interactive updating.

#### Required Attributes

    options (Array): Set of values that user can select from to answer. Cannot be empty. Each item must have a label, described below.

#### Optional Attributes

    label (String): A brief description of the expected user input.
    description (String): Extra context or guidance about filling out this form input. Supports Markdown.

#### ID

    id (String): Optional unique identifier. Can only contain alphanumeric characters, -, and _.

Within each item in options, the following fields are supported:

#### Required

    label (String): The text that will appear beside the checkbox. Markdown is supported for bold or italic text formatting, and hyperlinks.

#### Optional

    required (Boolean): If required, the form will not be submittable unless checked.

#### Example
```YAML
body:
- type: checkboxes
  id: cat-preferences
  attributes:
    label: What kinds of cats do you like?
    description: You may select more than one.
    options:
      - label: Orange cat (required. Everyone likes orange cats.)
        required: true
      - label: **Black cat**
```
